# Metaphor as Program

*A code art project exploring metaphors in a programmatic sense.*

---

## 🌱 Overview

**Metaphor as Program** is an experimental TypeScript project that explores how code can embody metaphor — not just explain it. It treats programming as both a technical language and a poetic one, showing how concepts like love, loss, balance, and connection can be **modeled, simulated, and felt** through simple functions.

This project is equal parts:

- 🧠 **Teaching tool** — showing how programming concepts can be introduced via metaphor  
- 💻 **Code poetry** — using real functions to explore relationship dynamics  
- 💌 **Personal reflection** — on what it means for emotional shifts to be calculable, resolvable, or not  

It was made for engineers, learners, poets, and anyone who has tried to understand something by breaking it into parts — and hoped it would add up to zero.

## 🧭 Philosophy

Every function in this repo is metaphor-first, computation-second. This is code as poetry, but also code as mirror — exploring what it means for things to cancel out, to resolve, or to resist resolution.

- Addition might represent mutual reinforcement.
- Subtraction could signify emotional extraction.
- Multiplication can be passion or pressure.
- Division might represent dependence, or the pain of splitting.
- Modulo reveals the remainder — what's left when one tries to divide into the other.
- Exponentiation represents power dynamics — one force shaping another.

## 🌌 Inspiration

This project was born from personal experience, reflection on love and its aftermath, and a desire to bridge the gap between logic and feeling. It asks whether code can help us process what language often fails to express — and whether precision can ever carry the weight of memory.

## 🧶 Future Possibilities

- Visualizations of emotional pairings over time
- A web interface for interactive metaphor modeling
- Expanded metaphors: grief as recursion, healing as functional purity, etc.
- Contributions from others exploring emotional computing

## 🤲 Contributions

While this project is personal, it is not closed. If you see something, feel something, or want to shape something within this space — you're welcome.
